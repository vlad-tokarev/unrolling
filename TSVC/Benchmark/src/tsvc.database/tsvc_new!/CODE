/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
to specify the desired environment:

__STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
_ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
_ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
_POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
_POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
_XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
_LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
_ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
_GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
_DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
__STRICT_ANSI__).
_REENTRANT		Select additionally reentrant object.
_THREAD_SAFE		Same as _REENTRANT, often used by other systems.
_FORTIFY_SOURCE	If set to numeric value > 0 additional security
measures are defined, according to level.

The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

These are defined by this file and are used by the
header files to decide what to declare or define:

__USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
__USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
__USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
__USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
__USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
__USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
__USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
__USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
__USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
__USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
__USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
__USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
__USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
__USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
__USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
__USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
__USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
__USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
__USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
__USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
__USE_REENTRANT	Define reentrant/thread-safe *_r functions.
__USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
to test for features.

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

16		-- \"natural\" 16-bit type (always short)
32		-- \"natural\" 32-bit type (always int)
64		-- \"natural\" 64-bit type (long or long long)
LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
program's portability.

Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
and int is always 32 bits.  */

defined if the corresponding type is *not* defined.

NetBSD defines _I386_ANSI_H_ and _X86_64_ANSI_H_ instead of _ANSI_H_ */
/* Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.

/* On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
_TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.

invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.  */

include gstddef.h, such as collect2.  */

symbols in the _FOO_T_ family, stays defined even after its
corresponding type is defined).  If we define wchar_t, then we
must undef _WCHAR_T_; for BSD/386 1.1 (and perhaps others), if
we undef _WCHAR_T_, then we must also define rune_t, since
headers like runetype.h assume that if machine/ansi.h is included,
and _BSD_WCHAR_T_ is not defined, then rune_t is available.
machine/ansi.h says, \"Note that _WCHAR_T_ and _RUNE_T_ must be of
the same type.\" */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
usually are.

This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
Most functions are declared using the macro:

__MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
`NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
`float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

__MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
usually are.

This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
Most functions are declared using the macro:

__MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
`NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
`float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

__MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
usually are.

This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
Most functions are declared using the macro:

__MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
`NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
`float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

__MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

double_t	floating-point type at least as wide as `double' used
to evaluate `double' expressions

FLT_EVAL_METHOD
Defined to
0	if `float_t' is `float' and `double_t' is `double'
1	if `float_t' and `double_t' are `double'
2	if `float_t' and `double_t' are `long double'

INFINITY	representation of the infinity value of type `float'

FP_FAST_FMA
FP_FAST_FMAF
FP_FAST_FMAL
If defined it indicates that the `fma' function
generally executes about as fast as a multiply and an add.
This macro is defined only iff the `fma' function is
implemented directly with a hardware multiply-add instructions.

FP_ILOGB0	Expands to a value returned by `ilogb (0.0)'.
FP_ILOGBNAN	Expands to a value returned by `ilogb (NAN)'.
